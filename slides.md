# Schedule

* W9D3 (Wednesday): Pre-Proposal due @ 9 am

* W9D4 (Thursday): Full Proposal due @ 9 am (after your idea has been approved)

* W10D3 (Wednesday): Project due & Presentations

# Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form

* An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some great libraries

* You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)

* Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example


---

# JS Project Requirements

* No unjustified use of Libraries (No Phaser or jQuery). Do your research and justify your choices. (We do want you to ask instructors before you utilize any API)

* Can be a game, but something original is best 
	* No Tetris, Mario, or any game that was an AA project 

* Can be a data visualization project! (D3)

* Choose something with an appropriate scope (project is due on W10D3)

* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty

* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

# Backend?

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)

* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 

* Backend skeleton is on AAO

# Scorecard 
* After your project has been approved, you will receive a scorecard from your project advisor
* This scorecard will be used to track your progress on your JSP, FSP, and job search materials

* [scorecard example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rT5PF9nOjSj6Ked7D7jR56doLfNhLcYYwHkr3F5Ghi8/edit#gid=80636460)

# Demo question:
[UNRESOLVED] When I put a debugger into my event handler, I hit it, and I see the data change - but that is not reflected in the render. Where should I look next?

5 SCREENSHOTS!!! Showing code, the weird behavior, the debugger, etc.
There will be a thread where we share resources and chat through the problem

---------after resolved---------- 

update the original posting like below 

[RESOLVED] Turns out that I was changing the data into a variable I was not saving, when I saved the variable it was reflected appropriately.
